%% To do:

% Establish Driving Equaitons/ Functions for new turbofan model
% Adjust on design inputs
% Put on design and off design into funcitons

% Assume 1 spool?
% How do we use static/takeoff thrust?
%% Read Me
% The following function creates performance charts of a subsonic turbofan

% Use Parametric Performance function to compute off design conditions
        % Change the way that burner fuel is calculated/ way max
        % temperature is estimated
        
        % Streamline inputs
        
% Find efficiency parameters

%% Off design plots
% Loop for each case
    % Use modified off design analysis for 2 spool, no afterburner, no mixer
        % No iterative scheme, performance is funciton of flight condition
        % Add theta break in later (or now since its easy?
